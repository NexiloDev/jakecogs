## Hey, I’m JakeFTL!

Welcome to `jakecogs`, my collection of custom cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). I built these for my gaming community to bridge our game servers—like Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy and Arma Reforger—with Discord, keeping everyone connected and in the loop. They’re tailored to our needs, but I’ve made them flexible and well-documented so anyone can use or tweak them for their own servers. Feel free to grab them, play around, and make them yours!

## Current Cogs

### JKChatBridge
#### Overview
`JKChatBridge` links a **Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy (JKA)** server to Discord. It uses RCON and log monitoring (`qconsole.log`) to relay chat, track player events, and manage server status—all with a sleek, emoji-rich vibe.

#### Features
- **Two-Way Chat**: Send messages between Discord and JKA.
- **Server Status**: `!jkstatus` shows players, map, and mod.
- **Player Stats**: `!jkplayer <username>` for detailed stats.
- **Events**: Join/disconnect, duels, and restart notifications (e.g., "⚠️ Standby" and "✅ Resumed").
- **Emoji Magic**: Converts text emotes (e.g., `:)` to 😊) and supports custom emojis.

#### Setup
1. Place `jkchatbridge.py` in `data/yourbotname/cogs/`.
2. Install: `pip install aiofiles`.
3. Load: `[p]load jkchatbridge`.
4. Configure (bot owner only):
   - `[p]jkbridge setchannel #channel`
   - `[p]jkbridge setrconhost 127.0.0.1`
   - `[p]jkbridge setrconport 29070`
   - `[p]jkbridge setrconpassword yourpass`
   - `[p]jkbridge setlogbasepath C:\path\to\lugormod`
   - `[p]jkbridge showsettings` to check.

#### Commands
- **All Users**: `!jkstatus`, `!jkplayer <username>`.
- **Admins**: `[p]jkexec <file>`, `[p]jkrcon <command>`, `[p]jktoggle` (join/disconnect messages).

#### Notes
- Built for Lugormod, tweak the log path for other mods.
- Windows-focused but adaptable.

### ArmaEvents
#### Overview
`ArmaEvents` connects an **Arma Reforger** server to Discord via the Server Admin Tools Events API. We use it for a DayZ game-mode, but its usable with any setup. It posts real-time updates for player joins, kills (player or zombie), and FPS drops.

#### Features
- **Event Posts**: Styled updates like “🧍 **[Arma] Jake** has rejoined the fight for survival!” or “🧟 **[Arma] Jake** got mauled by a zombie! 💀”.
- **Configurable**: Set everything via Discord commands.
- **DayZ Vibes**: Tailored for zombie survival servers.

#### Commands
| Command                  | Description                                   | Example                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| !arma setchannel #chan   | Set the event channel.                        | !arma setchannel #arma-updates                |
| !arma settoken token     | Set the API token.                            | !arma settoken mypassword123                  |
| !arma setaddress addr    | Set the HTTP address.                         | !arma setaddress http://localhost:8080/events |
| !arma showsettings       | Show current settings.                        | !arma showsettings                            |

##### Notes
- Requires Server Admin Tools mod on your Arma server.
- Token and address must match your server config.

#### Contributing
These cogs are free for anyone to use or tweak. Fork the repo, open issues, or send pull requests if you’ve got fixes or cool additions. I’ve tried to keep the code clean and the commands intuitive—dive in and make it your own!

#### Troubleshooting
No Messages? Check settings with showsettings commands and ensure server configs match.

Errors? Peek at Red Bot’s logs (data/yourbotname/logs/) for clues.
